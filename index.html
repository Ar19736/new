        Merky-ky-ky-ky<br>
Like<br>
<br>
My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop<br>
I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop<br>
Gettin' freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots<br>
Then I finish with a facial just to top it off (ayy)<br>
My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop<br>
I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop<br>
Gettin' freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots<br>
Then I finish with a facial just to top it off (ayy)<br>
<br>
You ain't got a clue, let's be honest<br>
I had a couple seeds, I made a forest<br>
I put in the work and take the profit<br>
Lookin' at my girl like "What a goddess" (thank God)<br>
Rule number two, don't make the promise<br>
If you can't keep the deal then just be honest (just be honest)<br>
I could never die, I'm Chuck Norris (Chuck Norris)<br>
Fuck the government and fuck Boris (yeah)<br>
I'm a villain, killin' when I'm barrin'<br>
Brothers in the hood just like the movie that I star in<br>
Servicin' my whip, I phoned the boss to bring my car in<br>
I could probably take your chick, but I just wouldn't 'cause she's jarrin', oh<br>
I got the sauce (sauce), don't know what you thought (thoughts)<br>
Catch me up in the snow in my sliders and my shorts (shorts)<br>
Chicks tryna get my brother Flipz to share his thoughts<br>
I think he's tryna tell me I should tell her he don't talk<br>
I don't fuck with her<br>
Yeah, I used to hit it but you're stuck with her<br>
Man, I wouldn't even try my luck with her<br>
Gyal say I'm bougie (word), way too exclusive (word)<br>
Chillin' in Dubai know I get it all inclusive (word)<br>
Now may I ask if you can find it in your spirit (yeah)<br>
To leave us all alone and go and mind your fuckin' business<br>
Lookin' in the mirror sayin', "Mikey, you're the illest" (yeah)<br>
When I'm James Bond, tryna live my movie like I'm Idris<br>
So we telling 'em look<br>
<br>
My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop (ayy)<br>
I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop (ayy)<br>
Gettin' freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots (ayy)<br>
Then I finish with a facial just to top it off (ayy)<br>
My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop (ayy)<br>
I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop (ayy)<br>
Gettin' freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots (ayy)<br>
Then I finish with a facial just to top it off (ayy)<br>
<br>
My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop<br>
So much Vossi I might open up a Vossi shop<br>
Mummy sayin' that I need to get some sleep<br>
All this flyin' overseas is always fuckin' up my body clock<br>
And all this stress has got me wrackin' at my brain (ayy, ayy)<br>
So tell these likkle fishes back up off my name (ayy, ayy)<br>
I ain't gotta be a rapper with a chain<br>
Cah the rules are kinda different when you're baddin' up the game (straight)<br>
Baddin' up the game, bad it up again (yeah)<br>
Had 'em up before, have 'em up again (yeah)<br>
Fake bruddas, man, your mandem will pretend (yeah)<br>
Pussy by himself, he's battlin' with his friends<br>
Aww, you man are so insecure, man, it's a joke (man, it's a joke)<br>
I need a Ballon D'or, 'cause I'm the GOAT (still the GOAT)<br>
If you believe in your source then raise a toast (raise a toast)<br>
These are some genius thoughts so make the most<br>
Told her "Save me some"<br>
I need all the homage, could you pay me some?<br>
Man a droppin' bangers on your baby mums<br>
Gyals say I'm rude (word), they wanna see me nude (word)<br>
My name stiff chocolate, I got nothing left to prove<br>
I got holes in my lapel, rubbin' shoulders with your girl<br>
Which one of, said that I would go to jail? (wah?)<br>
Well, I guess you have to hold a L<br>
Tell 'em "This is London city, we the hottest in the world"<br>
What we tellin' 'em? Look<br>
<br>
My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop (ayy)<br>
I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop (ayy)<br>
Gettin' freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots (ayy)<br>
Then I finish with a facial just to top it off (ayy)<br>
My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop (ayy)<br>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <p> 
 Ring, do you hear me callin'? <br>
Purps On The Beat<br>
Me no want no drama<br>
<br>
Do you hear me callin'?<br>
Do you hear me callin'?<br>
Me no want no drama<br>
Not a fighter, a lover<br>
Do you hear me callin'?<br>
Do you hear me callin'?<br>
Me no want no drama<br>
I just want you, my darling<br>
<br>
Break away and make a way to make it<br>
Love the way you looking when you naked<br>
Treat your heart just like a blunt of OG<br>
Roll it up, I kissed it and I smoke it<br>
<br>
Gots to be jokin'<br>
Where in the fuck did you think you were goin'?<br>
Folding and packing your clothes<br>
Like you ain't know I was gon' unfold it<br>
A wine glass full of your emotions<br>
Oh, Pinot Grigio, sipping, beautiful<br>
Heaven-soul woman<br>
<br>
Me don't know, let me know<br>
Let me in your heart<br>
Don't you dare forget me<br>
I'm your fan, your poster's on my walls<br>
Inside my head, yeah, yeah<br>
I'm your fan, your poster's on my walls<br>
Inside my head, yeah<br>
<br>
Do you hear me callin'?<br>
Do you hear me callin'?<br>
Me no want no drama<br>
Not a fighter, a lover<br>
Do you hear me callin'?<br>
Do you hear me callin'?<br>
Me no want no drama<br>
I just want you, my darling<br>
<br>
You drive me insane, no girl make me feel this way<br>
Wait girl, you got your ways, girl you are my getaway<br>
Wait, let me keep you safe<br>
In exchange, give me brain, brain<br>
You my main thing, turn around, bang bang<br>
<br>
Hit the beach in L.A. like you a beach ball<br>
Me and you in the Lambo' truck<br>
You start it up and skrrt off<br>
We park after dark at the park by the Mansion<br>
Take your skirt off<br>
Oh, me can't wait to get all up inside of it<br>
<br>
My heart is racing, every time I'm tasting it<br>
Wait until the drugs fade out<br>
Hate making love when I'm faded<br>
That's because I wanna feel it<br>
Girl, you give me the best feeling<br>
Yes, girl you the best, take away stress, love me to death<br>
Even when I'm a mess<br>
<br>
Do you hear me callin'?<br>
Do you hear me callin'?<br>
Me no want no drama<br>
Not a fighter, a lover<br>
Do you hear me callin'?<br>
Do you hear me callin'?<br>
Me no want no drama<br>
I just want you, my darling (darling)<br>
<br>
Ring, do you hear me callin'?<br>
Me no want no drama<br>
Ring, do you hear me callin'?<br>
Me no want no drama </p>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <p>
        Two thirty baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?<br>
Too early, maybe later you can show me things<br>
You know what it is, whenever I visit<br>
Windy city, she blowing me kisses, no<br>
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight<br>
Will I see you at the show tonight?<br>
Will I see you at the show tonight?<br>
<br>
Ayy, truck to the plane, to the truck<br>
Truck to the hotel lobby<br>
Me, I go through underground garages<br>
Presidential suite, on deposit<br>
Elevator up to the room<br>
Shower up and then we hit the club<br>
Touchdown, gotta see what's up<br>
Area code in my phone<br>
What numbers do I still have?<br>
Who do I know from the past?<br>
Hit one, she say she got a man<br>
Hit another one, it goes green<br>
Must've changed phones on the team<br>
'Member when you lead me in between?<br>
That was 2017<br>
All good, Chubbs'll look around<br>
Find one that seem my type<br>
That my dawg and he know what I like<br>
He done found me plenty in my life<br>
Problem is, I meet a girl tonight<br>
Then I go and treat her too nice<br>
Galleria credit card swipes<br>
I don't even know if she a wife<br>
<br>
But I do know one thing though<br>
Women they come they go<br>
Saturday, through Sunday, Monday<br>
Monday through Sunday, yo<br>
Maybe I'll love you one day<br>
Maybe we'll someday grow<br>
'Til then I'll sit my drunk ass on that runway<br>
On this one way<br>
<br>
Two thirty baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?<br>
Too early, maybe later you can show me things<br>
You know what it is, whenever I visit<br>
Windy city, she blowing me kisses, no<br>
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight<br>
Will I see you at the show tonight?<br>
Will I see you at the show tonight?<br>
<br>
Jewelry in the safe on arrival<br>
Pistol on J for survival<br>
Lot of people gunning for the title<br>
Lot of people trying to take us viral<br>
I'm just trying to have a nice night, though<br>
Waiter brought the check for the meal<br>
She said, "babe, I think there was a typo"<br>
Nah girl, I got it, that's light though<br>
I could show you bigger things than that<br>
It's gon' be a minute 'til I'm back<br>
Let me give you images that last<br>
AMEX had a limit in the past<br>
I had plenty women in the past<br>
I done plenty sinnin' in the past<br>
You don't need to know, but you can ask<br>
Stickin' on your backstage pass<br>
All access 'cause you bad<br>
You could go wherever with that ass<br>
Show, to the shower, to the truck<br>
Truck, to the club, for the party<br>
You go in first with your girls<br>
'Cause I don't know who's out there watching<br>
<br>
But I do know one thing though<br>
Women they come they go<br>
Saturday, through Sunday, Monday<br>
Monday, Sunday, yo<br>
Maybe I'll love you one day<br>
Maybe we'll someday grow<br>

I got woodgrain on my Damier Buckle (uh)<br>

Born with the drip and just learned how to hustle (hus')<br>
Look at your bitch through these Dior bifocals (look)<br>

Watch how I drip when I hit that Met Gala (yeah)<br>

Doctor told me I got lean in my bladder (mm)<br>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <p>
        My guy pretty like a girl
And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimmin' laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
<br>
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
12 treat a nigga like he 12
How you lookin' up to me and talkin' down?
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)
God level, I am the I am (Whoa)
Now film it with that drone cam, in the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick; Noé, up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back, yeah that's the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
<br>
Rollin' when you ride, poppin'
Rollin' when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight actin'
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016 burnt some discs
2017 ideas playin' off a Walkman
This a cult, not a clique on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
<br>
That's a double edge, "Issa knife"
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fightin'
Revenge in the air make my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick
Clips on clips like Mike
It's really you−
<br>
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
<br>
It's really you on my mind
It's really you on my mind
It's really you−
It's really you on my mind
<br>
V both sides of the 12
Steam both sides of the L
Freeze smoke rings and they hail
Sleet snow grind for the wealth
Whole team diamonds is real
Showed 'em how to shine by themselves
You need a cosign for your health
I need that bitch to grind on my belt
I know you need to try for my belt
I know you seen it drivin' itself
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale, but it's stealth
<br>
I see both sides like Chanel
I see both sides like Chanel
<br>
My pockets snug
They can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa
My Amex and Mastercards
I got new money
And it's all cash
I got new bags
And they all collabs
<br>
I rubber band a bunch of thousand dollar Delta gift cards
(I mean, my baby bi)
Amazin' the cash online unknown
(I mean, my baby bi)
Blazin' the dash, countin' money at home
<br>
My pockets snug
They can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa
My Amex and Mastercards
I got new money
And it's all cash
I got new bags
And they all collabs
<br>
I rubber band a bunch of thousand dollar Delta gift cards

        Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
<br>
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections
Clearly in Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
<br>
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
<br>
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say something so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye
<br>
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
<br>
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
<br>
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out
<br>
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you

        Hello<br>
I've been hurt so many times<br>
It got to a point<br>
When I decided<br>
I can't do this anymore<br>
I need someone to hold me<br>
I need someone that needs me<br>

You need me to get that shit together<br>

You need me to<br>

You know, we don't have to be dramatic<br>
Just romantic<br>
Do all the little things, little things, little things<br>
That excites me<br>
As your woman<br>
Give me a kiss goodnight<br>
Over the phone<br>
When you're working late<br>
When you're out of town<br>
Tell me how much you need this<br>
'Cause we deserve it<br>
We can be together, but<br>

You need me to get that shit together<br>
So we can get together<br>
You need me to get that shit together<br>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <p>
        He deals the cards as a meditation<br>
And those he plays never suspect<br>
He doesn't play for the money he wins<br>
He don't play for respect<br>
<br>
He deals the cards to find the answer<br>
The sacred geometry of chance<br>
The hidden law of a probable outcome<br>
The numbers lead a dance<br>
<br>
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier<br>
I know that the clubs are weapons of war<br>
I know that diamonds mean money for this art<br>
But that's not the shape of my heart<br>
<br>
He may play the jack of diamonds<br>
He may lay the queen of spades<br>
He may conceal a king in his hand<br>
While the memory of it fades<br>
<br>
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier<br>
I know that the clubs are weapons of war<br>
I know that diamonds mean money for this art<br>
But that's not the shape of my heart<br>
That's not the shape<br>
The shape of my heart<br>
<br>
If I told her that I loved you<br>
You'd maybe think there's something wrong<br>
I'm not a man of too many faces<br>
The mask I wear is one<br>
<br>
But those who speak know nothing<br>
And find out to their cost<br>
Like those who curse their luck in too many places<br>
And those who fear are lost<br>
<br>
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier<br>
I know that the clubs are weapons of war<br>
I know that diamonds mean money for this art<br>
But that's not the shape of my heart<br>
That's not the shape of my heart<br>
That's not the shape<br>
The shape of my heart<br>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <p>
        Look, black is beautiful, black is excellent<br>
Black is pain, black is joy, black is evident<br>
It's workin' twice as hard as the people you know you're better than<br>
'Cause you need to do double what they do so you can level them<br>
Black is so much deeper than just African-American<br>
Our heritage been severed, you never got to experiment<br>
With family trees, 'cause they teach you 'bout famine and greed<br>
And show you pictures of our fam on their knees<br>
Tell us we used to be barbaric, we had actual queens<br>
Black is watchin' child soldiers gettin' killed by other children<br>
Feelin' sick, like, "Oh shit, this could have happened to me"<br>
Your mummy watchin' tellin' stories 'bout your dad and your niece<br>
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice<br>
A kid dies, the blacker the killer, the sweeter the news<br>
And if he's white you give him a chance, he's ill and confused<br>
If he's black he's probably armed, you see him and shoot<br>
<br>
Look, black is growin' up around the barbershop<br>
Mummy sayin', "Stay away from trouble, you're in yard a lot"<br>
Studying for ages, appreciatin' the chance you got<br>
'Cause black is in your blood, and you ain't even got the heart to stop<br>
Black is steppin' in for your mother because your father's gone<br>
And standin' by your children when you haven't proven karma wrong<br>
Black is doin' all of the above then goin' corner shoppin'<br>
Tryna help a lady cross the road to have her walkin' off<br>
Black is growin' up around your family and makin' it<br>
Then being forced to leave the place you love because there's hate in it<br>
People say you fake the shit, never stayed to change the shit<br>
But black is bein' jealous, you'd be dead if you had stayed in it<br>
Black is strugglin' to find your history or trace the shit<br>
You don't know the truth about your race 'cause they erasin' it<br>
Black has got a sour fuckin' flavour, here's a taste of it<br>
But black is all I know, there ain't a thing that I would change in it<br>
<br>
Look, black ain't just a single fuckin' colour, man there's shades to it<br>
Her hair's straight and thick but mine's got waves in it<br>
Black is not divisive, they been lyin' and I hate the shit<br>
Black has never been a competition, we don't make this shit<br>
Black is deadly<br>
Black is when you're freezin' in your home and you can't get sleep but never feelin' empty<br>
'Cause you got 20 cousins in your country living stress-free<br>
Walkin' for their water, daughter wrapped inside a bed sheet<br>
Black is distant<br>
It's representin' countries that never even existed while your grandmother was livin'<br>
Black is my Ghanaian brother readin' into scriptures<br>
Doin' research on his lineage, findin' out that he's Egyptian<br>
Black is people namin' your countries on what they trade most<br>
Coast of Ivory, Gold Coast, and the Grain Coast<br>
But most importantly to show how deep all this pain goes<br>
West Africa, Benin, they called it slave coast<br>
Black is so confusin', 'cause the culture? They're in love with it<br>
They take our features when they want and have their fun with it<br>
Never seem to help with all the things we know would come with it<br>
Loud in our laughter, silent in our sufferin'<br>
Black is bein' strong inside and facing defeat<br>
Poverty made me a beast, I battled the law in the streets<br>
We all struggled, but your struggle ain't a struggle like me<br>
Well how could it be when your people gave us the odds that we beat?<br>
I mean, fuckin' hell, what about our brothers that are stuck in jail?<br>
That couldn't bust a bell, they held a bird and gotta live with it<br>
Black is bein' guilty until proven that you're innocent<br>
Black is sayin', "Free my fucking niggas stuck inside in prison cells"<br>
They think it's funny, we ain't got nothin' to say to them<br>
Unconditional love is strange to them; it's amazin' 'em<br>
Black is like the sweetest fuckin' flavour, here's a taste of it<br>
But black is all I know, there ain't a thing that I would change in it<br>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <p>
        I took my drugs and took my lovin' when I left out the spot<br>
I left the party with a Barbie, markin' X on the dot<br>
She calls my phone up but I told her, "I'm a loner" (uh)<br>
But she likes my watch and my droptop and my persona (uh)<br>
We hit the highway, 1-5-5, with my whole foot on the dash<br>
She's in my ear, she's got no fear, she could care less if we crash<br>
But on my radar, I've got some nerve to play hard<br>
I've waited for my chance, but playboys we don't dance, dance, dance<br>
<br>
I gave my heart<br>
Speedin' car goin' ninety in the rain<br>
She took my heart, filled it with nothin' but pain<br>
This beat in my hands is not for romance<br>
I wanna stay but, playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance<br>
<br>
So I won't dance again, oh, baby<br>
No, I won't dance again, ooh, yeah (uh)<br>
No, I won't dance again<br>
No, I won't dance again<br>
Pretty baby, ooh<br>
<br>
Oh, face in the daylight, wastin' time on the stars in the sky<br>
She's got my pager, play games of love all on my eyes<br>
Then I'm reminded, love don't come 'til you find it<br>
I just hope that it's workin', I'm yearnin', I'm searchin', uh<br>
The afterparty was on Wilson and 73rd<br>
You got the notion that somebody else was with me first<br>
But on my radar, you had some nerve to play hard<br>
You took away my chance, but playboys we don't dance, dance, dance<br>
<br>
I gave my heart (uh)<br>
Speedin' car goin' ninety in the rain<br>
She took my heart, filled it with nothin' but pain<br>
This beat in my hands is not for romance<br>
I wanna stay but, playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance<br>
<br>
So I won't dance again, oh, baby<br>
No, I won't dance again, ooh, yeah (uh)<br>
No, I won't dance again<br>
No, I won't dance again<br>

Flashing lights, lights, lights, lights<br>
Flashing lights, lights, lights, lights<br>
<br>
She don't believe in shooting stars, but she believe in shoes and cars<br>
Wood floors in the new apartment, couture from the store's department<br>
You more like the love to start shit, I'm more of the trips to Florida<br>
Order the hors d'oeuvre, views of the water<br>
Straight from the page of your favorite author<br>
<br>
And the weather so breezy, man, why can't life always be this easy?<br>
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy, I get a call like, "Where are you Yeezy?"<br>
Try to hit you with a ol-wu-wopte, 'till I get flashed by the paparazzi<br>
Damn, these niggas got me<br>
I hate these niggas more than the Nazis<br>

As I recall, I know you love to show off<br>
But I never thought that you would take it this far<br>
What do I know? (Flashing lights, lights, lights, lights)<br>

I know it's been a while, sweetheart<br>
We hardly talk, I was doing my thing<br>
I know I was foul, baby, A-bay lately, you been all on my brain<br>
And if somebody would've told me a month ago, fronting though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know<br>
If somebody would've told me a year ago, it'd go, get this difficult<br>

Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA, like Martin with no Gina<br>
Like a flight with no visa<br>
First class with the seat back, I still see ya<br>
In my past, you on the other side of the glass<br>
Of my memory's museum<br>

        Run that back, Turbo!<br>

You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it<br>

Taking these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the morning<br>
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it<br>
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performing<br>
The backend just came in, in all hundreds<br>
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us<br>
I'm from Atlanta, where young niggas run shit<br>
I know they hating on me, but I don't read comments<br>
Whenever I tell her to come, she coming<br>
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't running<br>
<br>
Drip too hard, don't stand too close<br>
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave<br>
Doing all these shows, I've been on the road<br>
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid<br>
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind<br>
Soon as I get back, she getting slayed<br>
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise<br>
Every other night, another movie get made<br>
<br>
Drip too hard, don't stand too close<br>
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave<br>
Doing all these shows, I've been on the road<br>
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid<br>
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind<br>
Soon as I get back, she getting slayed<br>
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise<br>
Every other night, another movie get made (yeah)<br>
<br>
Every other night, another dollar getting made<br>
Every other night started with a good day<br>
I feel like a child, I got boogers in the face<br>
Diamonds dancing in the dial, like this shit is a parade<br>
I don't want your chain, Young GunWun not a slave<br>
I had to draw the line, too many bitches getting saved<br>
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane<br>
These pussy niggas lacking, why I'm working on my aim<br>
Drip too hard (too hard), charge it to the card (to the card)<br>
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the names (uh)<br>
Drip too hard, caution on the floor<br>
You gon' fuck around and drown tryna ride a nigga wave<br>
<br>
Drip too hard, don't stand too close<br>
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave<br>
Doing all these shows, I've been on the road<br>
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid<br>
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind<br>
Soon as I get back, she getting slayed<br>
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise<br>
Every other night, another movie get made<br>
<br>
Drip too hard, don't stand too close<br>
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave<br>
Doing all these shows, I've been on the road<br>
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid<br>
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind<br>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <p>
        You used to be my baby<br>
Remember when you used to wear my chain and my bracelets<br>
I know you blushin' when I make a statement<br>
So don't you worry 'bout them bitches I don't entertain them<br>
They only want me 'cause I'm famous<br>
I'm A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie but just call me baby<br>
And I be rollin' with the gangstas<br>
Mask on, gloves on like they contagious<br>
But what you think about me<br>
Anything I put on I be lookin' ode<br>
Pull up to a party in a 'Rari 88<br>
Goin' 200 it was me and E3<br>
Pray when I decided I'ma go my own way<br>
She all on my body and she hopin' I stay<br>
I guess that's what happens when you run into the C.R.E.A.M<br>
Cash rules everything around me (Cash rules everything around me)<br>
<br>
But even when I'm with a new hoe<br>
I still end up thinkin' 'bout you<br>
Because they just don't know<br>
They don't know me like they really want to<br>
And everywhere I go<br>
When I come through all I see is wild thots<br>
<br>
Wild, wild, wild<br>
Wild, wild, wild thots<br>
Wild, wild, wild<br>
When I come through all I see is wild thots<br>
<br>
Look, let's keep it real and never fake it (fake it)<br>
Yeah, I'm gettin' money, they can't take it, take it, take it (I know)<br>
The vibe is off, I gotta shake it (skrt)<br>
Look, I'm nothin' like them no one to mistake it<br>
The sun is gon' shine even through the shady<br>
Just 'cause I play it Melo, don't think you can trade me<br>
You can't buy class, I bought a new Mercedes<br>
Came back on them birds, I'm the new Tom Brady<br>
Wow, all I see is wild life when I'm out<br>
Bunch of snakes, couple cats with my life in they mouth<br>
Lion like they gorillas really soft as chinchillas<br>
Don't sweat the butterfly after you diss the caterpillar<br>
That's wild<br>
Wild, wild, wild<br>
When I come through all I see is wild thots<br>
<br>
Wild, wild, wild<br>
Wild, wild, wild thots<br>
Wild, wild, wild<br>
When I come through all I see is wild thots<br>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <p>It's so hard to be human<br>
        It's so hard to just live and learn with all of your mistakes<br>
        It's double standards on all this (oo-oo)<br>
        It's got you movin' with caution<br>
        <br>
        Last one has you, they start talkin', sayin' you out way too often<br>
        There's some friends that got some history of bottle hoppin'<br>
        Look at me and you're so flawless<br>
        You're like twenty girls in Austin<br>
        It's like three or four a week (yeah)<br>
        I'm roundin' up at least a hundred<br>
        <br>
        No one changes ovеr night<br>
        They were lonеly years and were hard to find<br>
        Fairy tales don't come over night<br>
        Gotta work for it, work for it<br>
        I see, yeah, see you baby, I do<br>
        <br>
        They only see you (only see you)<br>
        For what you worth (what you worth)<br>
        That's not what I see when you in my face, yeah<br>
        That's not what I see when you at my place, yeah<br>
        That's not what I see, girl, you know, you<br>
        <br>
        Is it so hard to do what you came to do? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
        Donny's got a hold on you<br>
        And I know you'd rather lie here than tell the truth (yeah)<br>
        But I guess they out there talkin'<br>
        'Bout some bitches I don't know about<br>
        <br>
        I'm pressed 'bout you<br>
        Better pull up with that room key<br>
        I'm pressed 'bout you<br>
        They really into no small talk<br>
        I really out of your ballpark, oh yeah, oh yeah<br>
        <br>
        You think it's way too easy<br>
        You'll never believe me<br>
        Life come back in full circle (oo, yeah)<br>
        Unlike whatever it is, I don't really need it<br>
        That right there, just might hurt you<br>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <p>
        I was outside<br>
Had a pretty girl and a fast car, I was 21<br>
I ain't just anyone<br>
Better talk to me nicely<br>
And you know the weapon on me, the wrist on my best friend<br>
When I'm in the West End<br>
<br>
I had a wish<br>
God knows I wouldn't believe when I was a kid (when I was a kid)<br>
Ki Lo Fe if you wanna leave, there's plenty of fish<br>
And I know the bullet that kills, it comes with a kiss<br>
It's just how it is, like oh-oh-oh (assez de temps perdu, baby)<br>
<br>
Assez de temps perdu, baby<br>
Faut faire la monnaie, baby<br>
J'ai cherché la monnaie très vite<br>
Assez de temps perdu ici (assez de temps)<br>
Assez de temps perdu, baby<br>
Vu qu'la maison ne fait pas crédit, j'ai dû chercher la monnaie très vite<br>
<br>
Assez d'attente, file-nous l'enveloppe<br>
J'ai des affaires qui m'attendent à sept-huit heures de vol, eh<br>
J'te conseille de faire gaffe si tu t'emportes<br>
J'porte mon meilleur ami sous mon jeans si j'vois tu m'bloques<br>
<br>
Jesu aleselewi (Vuitton, Balenciaga)<br>
Mek I travel overseas (Jamaïque, Copacabana)<br>
Had a dream, I had a dream (Martin Luther ou Obama)<br>
Now my family was free (leur offrir Dolce Gabbana)<br>
No sabi? Ola plenty (enjoy toute la mañana)<br>
Mercredi to vendredi (Vuitton, Balenciaga)<br>

Oh-oh-oh<br>
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
Like oh-oh-oh<br>
<br>
Big H on the belt, meridian whip, obsidian, chick, Parisian<br>
Ringside, box full of white, like Dillian, me and my killion, form like Kiylian<br>
Birkin crocodile, like Skillibeng, sick of them, turned to a rich man, Twickenham<br>
Any type of-, on sale, consider them<br>
<br>
King Charles, T.E.C with a prince, get rid of them<br>
No limit, j'viens pour casser la porte et les terminer<br>
J'viens pour casser les codes, renoi sans limites<br>
Ne vous inquiétez pas, c'était pas voulu<br>
Si on m'retrouve autour de Nathalie ou Nekeisha et Stéphanie<br>
Sors ton bikini de la valise, eh, un cocktail pour s'emballer (ça y est, oh)<br>

Assez d'attente, file-nous l'enveloppe<br>

Eh, every girl wants a boy like me (like me)<br>
Elles connaissent pas, c'est mon train d'vie<br>
Comme Skillibeng, j'ai les crocodiles teeth, j'ai sécurisé Neverland pour toute une nuit<br>
On pourra enjoy, enjoy toute la nuit<br>
Notre présence vaut déjà un Grammy ou une médaille d'or aux Jeux Olympiques<br>
On m'a répéter encore<br>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <p>
        I lost my way, somewhere in another galaxy ('xy)<br>
Too much to take, these memories, end in tragedy ('gy)<br>
And all of these places, all of these faces<br>
I didn't wanna let you down (down)<br>
And all these mistakes of mine, I can't replace it<br>
I gotta move on somehow<br>
<br>
Healing energy on me<br>
Baby, all I really need's one thing<br>
Healing energy on me<br>
Baby, can you make a wish for me?<br>
Healing energy on me<br>
When it's 11:11, I need it<br>
Healing energy on me<br>
Baby, can you make a wish for me?<br>
<br>
11:11, oh<br>
11:11<br>
When it's 11:11, I need it<br>
<br>
Anxiety<br>
Don't let the pressure get to your head<br>
You know we play for keeps<br>
Don't let it go over your head<br>
<br>
Heavy stepper, I got too much weight on this<br>
You can see the diamonds, don't complain on this (me)<br>
We was hustling, you n- got no say on this (no)<br>
I'm just being honest<br>
I'm moving steady (shoot)<br>
You can't buy success, ain't got no sale on it<br>
You know that God did, he never gon' fail on us<br>
Too much paper, got me thinking I'ma save all this<br>
I know the opps want it, they love this<br>
<br>
Two-tone, got the bussdown like woah (woah)<br>
The streets crazy, they don't love me no more (oh)<br>
Not one for pressure, but I'll bang for my bros (bros)<br>
Walking in Giuseppe, I be ten on my toes<br>
<br>
Welcome all the smoke (smoke, smoke, smoke, ski)<br>
Mama, pray for me, so I won't fold (fold)<br>
Walking ten toes<br>
I be paranoid, but nobody knows (woah)<br>
<br>
Anxiety<br>
Don't let the pressure get to your head (head)<br>
You know we play for keeps (for keeps)<br>
Don't let it go over your head<br>
<br>
Steady, moving onto greater (ghetto, ghetto)<br>
Never thought that I'd be ready (ready)<br>
She let me, I let her keep her things (keep)<br>
She told me, "Why didn't you just fight for it?"<br>
All these baddies, had too many (many)<br>
I promised that I would have died for it<br>
You just had to f- let me (let me)<br>
<br>
Now I'm married to the game, I'm in that<br>
No more chains, I'ma buy me some gold (woah)<br>
Three babies, tryna make room for some more (ooh)<br>
Life learning lessons 'cause you reap what you sow (grow)<br>
Walking in Giuseppe, I be ten on my toes<br>
<br>
You know I welcome all the smoke (smoke, smoke, smoke, ski)<br>
Mama, pray for me, so I won't fold (fold)<br>
Walking ten toes (ten toes)<br>
I be stressing out, but nobody knows (yeah, yeah)<br>

Anxiety (anxiety)<br>
Don't let the pressure get to your head (don't let it get to your head)<br>

Welcome all the smoke (welcome all the smoke, ooh)<br>
